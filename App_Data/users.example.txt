# This file contains a list of hashed user credentials that are allowed access
# to the deploy website.
#
# The actual file used for authentication is /App_Data/users.txt
#
# You can generate entries for users.txt by using the 'deploy hash <username>' command
# from the command-line interface.
# 
# Format is <username> <iterations>:<salt>:<password-hash>
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#
# The example password below is 'secret'... obviously, don't use this in production!
